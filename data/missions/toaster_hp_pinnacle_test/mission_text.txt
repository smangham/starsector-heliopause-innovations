Approaching the edge of the Persean Sector, the Pinnacle-class ISS Pride of Maxios experiences a sudden failure of its storm damping systems, and is forced to take shelter in a small local shallow in hyperspace. Whilst making repairs they are joined by a fleet on a bearing from the Persean Abyss. With transponders off, and refusing to respond to hails, the new arrivals bear down on the ISS Pride of Maxios, powering up their weapons.
