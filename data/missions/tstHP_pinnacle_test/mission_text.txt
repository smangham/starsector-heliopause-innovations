Investigating unusual signals from an old Domain sensor relay, a survey fleet led by the Pinnacle-class ISS Pride of Opis approaches the southern edge of the Persean sector. Though theoretically safe from the perils of hyperspace, as a cataclysmic storm approaches the flagship's hyperfield projectors begin to overload. With the brief window of protection that remains the captain wrestles the fleet into the protection of a local shallow.

As the technicians complete their repairs, another storm-tossed fleet arrives at their haven, their bearing suggesting a path from the Persean Abyss. Introductory comms requests are rebuffed, and they bear down on the beleaguered explorers. Unable to rely on their systems to flee through the storm, the fleet are left with no choice but to defend themselves.
