After a brutal confrontation with a Tri-Tachyon fleet whilst sheltering from a hyperspace storm, an independent surveyor completes their repairs whilst waiting for the storm to die down.

As they work, several drifting hulks are tossed into their shallow by the vagaries of the storm. Survey teams are dispatched, looking for salvage in order to make the trip worthwhile, but as their shuttles approach the should-be wrecks sensor readings begin to spike. The lead shuttle is vaporised by a highly-energetic arc, and the captain orders a full retreat - better the mercy of the storm, than a dance with the dead.
