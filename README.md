# Heliopause Innovations



## Description

This is a template for a generic Starsector mod using Java.

When you are done, you will have a mod that does nothing, but is ready for anything to be added.

Written for IntelliJ Community ([free download](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)), but should work with any IDE.
You do NOT need IntelliJ Ultimate. Latest version of IntelliJ is 2024.3 as of writing.

## Optional

- Change `LICENSE` to something else.

## Getting Started

Go to the Independent world of **Ailmar**, in the **Westernesse system**, and talk to the CEO of Heliopause Industries there. 
They'll pay you for your sensor data, and once you've donated enough they'll start giving you missions.

## FAQ

> Is this save-compatible?

Unfortunately, changes to hyperspace require a new save.
